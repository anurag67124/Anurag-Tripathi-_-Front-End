question 1: Explain what the simple List component does.

Answer: The List component is a React component that displays a list of items. 
        Each item is rendered using the SingleListItem component. 
        When an item is clicked, its index is stored in the component's state as the selectedIndex, 
        and that item is highlighted with a green background. 
        The previously selected item is then unselected (i.e., its background color is changed back to red).
